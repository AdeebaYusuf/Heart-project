This project involves analysis of the heart disease patients dataset with proper data processing. Dataset has been checked for any missing or duplicate values and thus those values have been fixed.
Dataset is analysed by finding different statistical measures and plotting the graphs to check the relationship of different parameters with having heart disease using matplot libraray and seaborn library. Various inferences has been made by analysing the plots. 
This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variablepredicting whether heart disease is present or not. Then Logistic Regression model(scikit learn) is trained using training data.
Model is evaluated using accuracy score. Accuracy achieved: 82%
Then we built a predictive system thst predicts if a person will get heart disease or not by entering its features
